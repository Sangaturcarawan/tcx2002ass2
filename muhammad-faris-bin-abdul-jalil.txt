1. After performing EDA on the Boston Housing dataset, which variable shows
the strongest negative correlation with the target variable 'medv' (median
home value)? (1 marks)

'lstat' shows the strongest negative correlation with the target variable 'medv'.
The correlation matrix shows that there is a correlation coefficient of -0.7376627 between these two variables which is the most negative.

Residual standard error: 4.611 on 342 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7482,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7386 
F-statistic: 78.15 on 13 and 342 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

- intercept estimate of 33.593363 means that when all other predictors are 0, the baseline of medv is about $33 593.36
- crim estimate of -0.091542 shows that when the crime rate rises by 1%, the median home value decreases by $92.54, assuming all other predictors are constant and crim variable is signficant
- ptratio estimate of -0.928753 means that larger class sizes would have a negative effect on home values
- very low Pr(>|t|) valuptratioes (p<0.01) for rm, lstat, ptratio,nox and chas means they are statistically significant to medv
- most predictors have very low p values (p < 0.05) except for age, indus and zn meaning most are statistically significant
- F-statistic of 78.15 with a p value less than 2.2e-16 (p < 0.001) means that the overall model is statistically significant (predictors as a whole explain a significant portion of the variation in medv)
- model's Adjusted R-squared value of 0.7386 indicates that the predictors together can explain about 73.86% of the variation in medv, which shows a strong fit for the real world data
- residual standard error of 4.611 means that the predicted medv is expected to deviate from the actual ones by $4611

3. What is the difference between your train and test accuracy. What does it tell
you? (1 +1 marks)

> train_pred <- predict(full_mdl, newdata = train)
> test_pred <- predict(full_mdl, newdata = test)
> train_r2 <- cor(train_pred, train$medv)^2
> test_r2 <- cor(test_pred, test$medv)^2
> train_r2
[1] 0.7481554
> test_r2
[1] 0.7207317
> train_r2 - test_r2
[1] 0.02742374

- The R squared for the training set is 0.7481554 which means that the model explains 74.8% of the variation in medv for the data it was trained on
- The R squared for the testing set is 0.7207317 which means that the model explains 72.1% of the variation in the unseen data
- a difference of 0.02742374 between these two values which is quite small means that the model performs well on the train and unseen data so it generalizes well and not overfitting
- this model can be used to predict and estimate values for new properties well


4. If you retain ‘rm’ in your final model, what is the coefficient for 'rm' (average
rooms per dwelling). What is the correct business interpretation? (1 marks)

- based on the summary given above, the coefficient estimate for rm is 3.964627
- this means that for every extra room per dwelling, the medv or median home value increases by about $3964.63
- this assumes that all other factors / predictors / independent variables remain constant
- so this means that houses with more rooms will become more valuable
- this means that it makes more business sense to build more houses with more rooms
- buyers are more likely to pay more for it and they can expect to sell it at a way higher price
- this can be marketed to potential buyers as a lucrative investment


5. Identify the top 2 predictors of the medv price based on variable importance
analysis of your final model. (1 marks)

- the top 2 predictors are rm (8.652778) and lstat (7.796054)

6. What is the R-squared of your final model? Provide a business interpretation.
(1 + 1 marks)

- Multiple R-squared:  0.7482,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7386 from the summary
- roughly about 74% (73.86%) of the variation in the median house value (medv) can be explained by the 13 predictors in the model
- from the business perspective, it means that the model is quite accurate, reliable and trustworthy
- but it must be noted that about 26% of the variation is unexplained probably due to other hidden factors or randomness
